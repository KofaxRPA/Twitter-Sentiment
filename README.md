# Twitter-Sentiment
Calculates the sentiment of tweets.  
Twitter actively blocks robots from access tweets and heavily obfuscates their website. You should use a developer key.  
With a free Twitter Developer Key you can search Twitter for a hashtag in tweets from the last 7 days.  

## Get a Twitter Developer Key
https://developer.twitter.com/en/account/get-started  
(this can take a week as you have to answer some emails from Twitter about what you are doing)
 * create an app
 * Set an App Name
 * Enter App Details
 * Copy Keys and tokens
   * API key
   * API secret key
 * Review permissions for read & write access
You will then need to add your Twitter APIkey and APISecretKey to the password repository in Management Console.
